# fastapi-authentication  

Authentication system for FARM stack - FastAPi, React, MongoDB  

Focusing mainly on backened.  
Recieves username and password from frontend, authenticates with oauth2 and returns jwttoken.  

The frontend kinda does'nt work (yet).  Just a reference of how api calls are implemented in the front end :)
